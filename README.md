Carefully read and follow the GWP submission instructions below:

Before the submission deadline:

Read the GWP1 Assignment & Grading Rubric
Make sure that you are familiar with the Group Work Policy
Use the GWP Report Template for your report. Make sure that you have included full names and email addresses of all group members and have indicated whether or not they actively contributed to the work. In addition, those who did not contribute should be given all 0 (zero) points for the collaboration grade.
While completing the project, designate one group member who will upload and submit the group work project on behalf of your group.
Donâ€™t wait until the last minute to upload your work: Make sure to use Turnitin and check your similarity report to avoid plagiarism.
Remember, the submitting group member can (re-)upload an updated and improved version of your work up to 5 times prior to the submission deadline.
Before the submission deadline, use Turnitin to check your similarity report, and then upload an updated version of your submission if necessary
Ready to submit:

If your submission is composed of multiple files, upload the PDF report separately from the zipped folder that includes all additional files (spreadsheets with data, charts, code).
Make sure that the submitting group member has uploaded the final version of your project.
After the deadline, your submission can no longer be changed by any of the group members. Groups who have not made any submission will not be able to upload their work.
